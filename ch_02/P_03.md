/*
 * Chapter 2 - Problem 3
 * When a floating-point number is converted to an integer in C++, the value is truncated by 
 * throwing away any fraction. Thus, when 4.99999 is converted to an integer, the result is 4. In 
 * many cases, it would be useful to have the option of rounding a floating-point value to the 
 * nearest integer. Given a positive floating-point number x, you can round it to the closest 
 * integer by adding 0.5 and then truncating the result to an integer. Because truncation always 
 * moves toward zero, rounding negative numbers requires you to subtract 0.5, rather than adding it.
 * 
 * Write a function roundToNearestInt(x) that rounds the floating-point number x to the nearest 
 * integer. Show that your function works by writing a suitable main program to test it.
