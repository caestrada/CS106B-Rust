2.4

If you are unfortunate enough to be outside in winter weather, you know that your perception of the cold is dependent on the wind speed as well as the temperature. The faster the wind blows, the colder you feel. To quantify the how wind affects temperature perception, the National Weather Service reports the **wind chill**, which is illustrated on their website as shown

![fig-2-17](./images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-07%20at%208.34.02%20AM.png)

As you can see at the bottom of Figure 2-17, the National Weather Service calculates wind chill using the formula

35.74 + 0.6215 * t – 35.75 * v^0.16 + 0.4275 * t * v^0.16

where t is the Fahrenheit temperature and v is the wind speed in miles per hour.

Write a function **windChill** that takes the values of t and v and returns the wind chill. In doing so, your function should take account of two special cases:
* If there is no wind, windChill should return the original temperature t.
* If the temperature is greater than 40° F, the wind chill is undefined, and
your function should call error with an appropriate message.

Although it will be easier to do so once you learn how to format numeric data in Chapter 4, you already know enough to generate a table that presents the wind-chill data in columns as shown in Figure 2-17. If you’re up for more of a challenge, write a main program that uses **windChill** to produce that table.

```rust
fn main() {
    for v in (5..=60).step_by(5) {
        for t in (-45..=40).rev().step_by(5) {
            let res = wind_chill(t as f32, v as f32) as i32;

            print!("{:>5}", res);
        }

        println!();

    }
}

fn wind_chill(t: f32, v: f32) -> i32 {
    if v == 0.0 {
        return round_to_nearest_int(t);
    }

    if t > 40.0 {
        println!("Error");
    }

    let wind_chill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * t) - (35.75 * v.powf(0.16)) + (0.4275 * t * v.powf(0.16));

    round_to_nearest_int(wind_chill)
}

fn round_to_nearest_int(mut num: f32) -> i32 {
    let is_negative = num < 0.0;

    if is_negative {
        num = num - 0.5;
    } else {
        num = num + 0.5;
    }

    num as i32
}
```
